## Features

- My ReadMe Generator is able to generate a readme file easily, so that when you are done with a project, you don't have to do it entirely yourself. 

- It generates a readMe with a title, description, installation instructions, usage directions, collaborators, license, features, how to make contributions, email, and github information.
